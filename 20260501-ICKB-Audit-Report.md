# iCKB Contracts Security Review

- **Review completion date:** 2026-05-01.
- **Reviewed contracts commit:** [`454cfa9`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/tree/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2). This is the last commit that changed `scripts/contracts/**` or `scripts/Cargo.toml`.
- **Executable test evidence:** current `scripts/tests/**` suite in this repository state.
- **Scope:** `iCKB Logic`, `Owned Owner`, `Limit Order`, and the shared `utils` crate.
- **Cross-references:** the [iCKB whitepaper](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md) and Nervos L1 reference implementations.
- **Prior external audit:** [Scalebit (2024-09-10)](https://scalebit.xyz/reports/20240911-ICKB-Final-Audit-Report.pdf). That audit reported three issues: two informational and one minor.

## Executive Summary

Under the current deployment assumptions, the review confirmed one live issue: the known `Limit Order` confusion attack.

- `iCKB Logic` has a provenance-blind path: receiptless DAO-shaped outputs can later be treated as deposits, and a separately funded aggregate-deposit path can realize the split-vs-aggregate soft-cap spread.
- Even so, the current `iCKB Logic` tests do not show theft, duplicated principal, or a standalone profit path beyond assets the caller already controls.
- `Limit Order` remains vulnerable to phantom-order continuation, real-order stranding through fake match-state cells, and master rebinding when cloned or otherwise indistinguishable orders are cross-wired at mint or during match.
- `Owned Owner` preserves its pairing rules under the current whole-transaction-binding lock model; the remaining weak-lock claim-reassignment cases stay at the integration boundary.
- All other candidate issues are blocked paths, generic CKB model constraints, or boundary cases relevant only to future integrations.

## Findings Summary

One known live issue remains in scope.

| ID | Status | Component | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| LO-01 | Known | `Limit Order` | CKB [does not execute output locks at creation time](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/types.rs#L716-L739), and [`limit_order` accepts swapped mint pairings](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L71-L79), so phantom and cross-wired order/master lineages can survive into later match or melt flows. |

## Protocol Model and Assumptions

The component analyses below rely on the following protocol model and deployment assumptions.

iCKB is an inflation-protected CKB token (`xUDT`) that tokenizes NervosDAO deposits into a liquid, fungible asset. The protocol owns all CKB deposits in a shared pool. Users deposit CKB and receive iCKB; later, they can burn iCKB to withdraw from any mature deposit in that pool.

Three on-chain scripts govern that flow:

1. **iCKB Logic** (dual-role): lock script on deposit cells, type script on receipt cells. Enforces the core balance equation and deposit-receipt accounting.
2. **Owned Owner**: pairs withdrawal request cells with owner cells so users can claim NervosDAO phase 2 withdrawals.
3. **Limit Order**: enables order-book-style exchange between CKB and UDTs, abstracting over NervosDAO and iCKB protocol constraints.

### Key Flows

**Deposit (two phases)**:

- Phase 1: CKB locked into NervosDAO deposit cells (lock = iCKB Logic, type = DAO). Receipts (type = iCKB Logic) track the deposits.
- Phase 2: Receipts converted to iCKB `xUDT` tokens using the deposit block's accumulated rate (AR).

**Withdrawal**:

- Phase 1: iCKB burned to release deposits from the pool into NervosDAO withdrawal requests.
- Phase 2: Standard NervosDAO withdrawal (outside iCKB scope).

**Mixed transactions**: A single transaction can combine deposit phase 1, phase 2, and withdrawal operations.

The next four execution rules explain why later findings hold or fail.

### Script Grouping

Mixed transactions execute `iCKB Logic` twice, but both runs see the same global cells and apply the same checks, so the dual execution does not create a desync path. CKB groups scripts by both hash and role. From [`script/src/types.rs:179-180`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/types.rs#L179-L180):

> A cell can have a lock script and an optional type script. Even they reference the same script, lock script and type script will not be grouped together.

Lock groups and type groups are stored in separate `BTreeMap`s ([`types.rs:657-659`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/types.rs#L657-L659)). `iCKB Logic` uses the same `{code_hash, Data1, empty_args}` for both roles, so a mixed transaction produces one lock group for deposit cells and one type group for receipt cells.

Both groups still see the same global cell set (`Source::Input` and `Source::Output`, not group-local sources) and apply the same balance checks, so duplicate execution does not create a path where one run succeeds and the other fails.

Script group construction at [`types.rs:716-740`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/types.rs#L716-L740): lock groups are built from input locks only; type groups are built from both input and output types.

### xUDT Owner Mode

`xUDT` owner mode stays within iCKB accounting because, in the deployed configuration, only two owner-mode routes are live and both co-execute `iCKB Logic`.

iCKB `xUDT` args are built as [`[ickb_logic_hash, XUDT_ARGS_FLAGS]`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L116-L126) with [`XUDT_ARGS_FLAGS = 0x80000000`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/constants.rs#L1-L2).

RFC 0052's [owner-mode update](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0052-extensible-udt/0052-extensible-udt.md#owner-mode-update) has four triggers: matching `input lock`, matching `input type`, matching `output type`, and a witness `owner_script` whose hash matches the owner hash in args.

In the deployed configuration, the upstream [`xudt_rce.c` flag parsing](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L383-L458) enables `input lock` by default, enables `input type` when `flags & 0x80000000` is non-zero, and enables `output type` only when `flags & 0x40000000` is non-zero. It also [falls back to the witness `owner_script` path](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L645-L649).

The witness `owner_script` path requires an exported [`validate` symbol](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L36-L36) loaded via [`ckb_dlsym`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L91-L113), while [`iCKB Logic`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/main.rs#L23-L35) is built as a CKB entrypoint (`program_entry` via `ckb_std::entry!`), not an xUDT `validate` extension. Under iCKB's deployed args `[ickb_logic_hash, 0x80000000]`, the live owner-mode paths are:

- A receipt (input type = iCKB Logic): needed for phase 2 minting
- A deposit (input lock = iCKB Logic): fires during withdrawal

In both cases `iCKB Logic` co-executes, as a type script for receipts or a lock script for deposits. Under this design, `xUDT` cannot enter owner mode without `iCKB Logic` also running.

### NervosDAO Interaction

The [deposit phase 1 section of the iCKB whitepaper](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#deposit-phase-1) pins `NervosDAO` to the historical [`814eb82` `dao.c`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c). That version enforces the known [64-output-cell limit](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L565-L591) with an [`output_withdrawing_mask` bitset](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L445). iCKB inherits that as a platform constraint, but its own correctness does not depend on the limit.

Key NervosDAO constraints confirmed against the [whitepaper-pinned `dao.c`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c):

- Withdrawal request must be at the [same output index](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L518-L523) as the consumed deposit.
- Withdrawal request capacity must [equal the deposit capacity](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L356-L365).
- Withdrawal request lock is [not checked by `validate_withdrawing_cell`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L339-L385), but current CKB nodes still apply the [DaoScriptSizeVerifier](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/verification/src/transaction_verifier.rs#L811-L885), so the withdrawing lock must at least match the consumed deposit lock's serialized size.
- AR is read from [`deposit_data.dao[8]`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L282-L283), matching iCKB's [`AR_OFFSET = 160 + 8`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L51).

### Header Access

Header access explains why iCKB uses a two-phase deposit flow. From [`script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs):

- For `Source::Input`: returns the header of the block containing the cell's creation transaction. The block hash must appear in [`header_deps`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs#L62-L66).
- For `Source::Output`: always returns `INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND` ([`load_header.rs:80`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs#L80)). Deposits require two phases.

Two shared boundaries matter in the later sections: authorization and accounting.

### Authorization Boundary

Several candidate issues turn on the boundary between lock-script authorization and type-script accounting. The [lock script](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#lock-script) / [type script](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#type-script) split means ownership is enforced by the user lock, while `ickb_logic` enforces value conservation. Its [balance equation](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L28-L34) and [cell classification](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L69-L81) never inspect who receives the output `iCKB` or the phase-1 DAO claim.

Under the [current whole-transaction-binding user-lock assumption](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#ancillary-scripts), that division is acceptable because the user's signature commits to the full transaction. The deployment model used for this review assumes current user-facing iCKB flows use strong transaction-binding locks and does not treat delegated or adopted `OTX` flows as in-scope present-day integrations.

The weak-lock tests in this report do not replay a current wallet path. They model future or custom delegated, `OTX`, or other non-output-binding integrations, where recipient binding is an integration invariant rather than a guarantee provided by the iCKB contracts.

Executed regressions show why that stays a boundary case rather than a current finding:

- **Weak-lock behavior:** Recipient reassignment is possible in both `iCKB Logic` and `Owned Owner`. The [phase-2 weak-lock redirect test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/phase2_recipient_binding.rs) and the [withdrawal weak-lock redirect test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/weak_lock_output_rebinding.rs) demonstrate that weak-lock path.
- **Signed phase-2 minting:** Once `sighash` binds the full transaction, phase-2 redirects stop working. The [phase-2 sighash binding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/phase2_recipient_binding.rs) and the [mixed phase-2 sighash binding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/phase2_recipient_binding.rs) show that binding.
- **Signed withdrawals:** The same redirect pattern fails for withdrawal outputs once `sighash` binds the transaction. The [withdrawal sighash binding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/weak_lock_output_rebinding.rs) and the [mixed withdrawal sighash binding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/weak_lock_output_rebinding.rs) show the same result.
- **Witness binding:** The [input-group signing test](scripts/tests/src/tests/signing.rs) and the [full-witness signing test](scripts/tests/src/tests/signing.rs) confirm the witness-binding model used by the signed path.

The same [ancillary scripts section](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#ancillary-scripts) already warns that delegated and `OTX` ownership patterns have their own pitfalls.

### Accounting Basis and Build Setting

The main accounting claims in this report rest on three properties:

1. **Balance equation:** [`entry.rs:32`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L32) enforces `in_udt + in_receipts == out_udt + in_deposits`.
2. **Deposit-receipt accounting:** [`entry.rs:132-137`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L132-L137) requires `deposited == receipted` per amount bucket.
3. **Overflow checks:** [`overflow-checks = true`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/Cargo.toml#L6) keeps the release-build accumulators from silently wrapping.

Together, these preserve protocol accounting across deposit, conversion, withdrawal, and mixed transactions.

### Methodology

The review prioritized executable behavior over static plausibility and classified issues by their concrete impact.

- Reviewed the deployed release binaries and the transaction semantics they actually enforce, not just the latest source-level intent.
- Reproduced script behavior locally with `ckb-testtool`, using executable transaction tests rather than relying on inspection alone.
- Reused and extended the existing test suite, including replayed transaction shapes from observed protocol flows.
- Computed NervosDAO accounting with the exact DAO withdrawal math before classifying any claim-path discrepancy as a finding.
- Separated findings that affect the current deployment from weak-lock assumptions, operator mistakes, or broader integration-only scenarios.
- Removed or downgraded candidate issues that did not yield a harmful state transition, exploitable profit path, or realistic user loss.
- Explicitly tested mixed transactions and script-group interactions because iCKB safety depends on whole-transaction execution rather than isolated cell intent.

### Test Coverage

A [module wiring overview](scripts/tests/src/tests.rs) plus the [test layout note](scripts/tests/README.md) show three layers:

- **Test harness and utilities:** [root harness](scripts/tests/src/tests.rs), [fixtures](scripts/tests/src/tests/fixtures.rs), [encoders](scripts/tests/src/tests/encoders.rs), [signing](scripts/tests/src/tests/signing.rs), and [replay_helpers](scripts/tests/src/tests/replay_helpers.rs).
- **Scenario suite roots:** [ickb_logic](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic.rs), [owned_owner](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner.rs), [limit_order](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order.rs), and [replay](scripts/tests/src/tests/replay.rs), each wiring topic-focused files under the matching subdirectory.
- **Helper-focused unit coverage:** [helpers](scripts/tests/src/tests/helpers.rs), which checks the shared encoders and witness/data builders used by the larger suites.

A fresh `cargo test -p tests` run passed `214` tests with no failures. Those tests cover deployment-hash sanity checks, helper encodings, core flows, blocked-path regressions, and replayed transaction shapes across `iCKB Logic`, `Owned Owner`, and `Limit Order`.

The strong-lock regressions in `ickb_logic`, `owned_owner`, and `signing` replay `secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all` as the representative whole-transaction-binding lock. This repo does not include a `QRL` fixture or harness, so conclusions for other strong-lock deployments rely on the same binding property and the stated deployment assumptions rather than a separate in-repo replay.

## Limit Order

The deployed [`Limit Order`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs) binary still carries one live issue: the known confusion attack. No other candidate path in this component validates as a live issue.

### Design

`Limit Order` supports three operations: `Mint` (create order plus master), `Match` (partial or full fill), and `Melt` (destroy order plus master). Orders store exchange ratios (`ckb_to_udt`, `udt_to_ckb`) and a minimum match size.

### Key Validations

**Value conservation** ([`entry.rs:103-105`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L103-L105)): uses [`C256`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/c256.rs) (checked U256) to prevent overflow.

```rust
if i.ckb * ckb_mul + i.udt * udt_mul > o.ckb * ckb_mul + o.udt * udt_mul
```

**Concave ratio check** ([`entry.rs:233-235`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L233-L235)): ensures round-trip conversion doesn't lose value for the maker:

```rust
if c2u.ckb_mul * u2c.udt_mul < c2u.udt_mul * u2c.ckb_mul
```

**Minimum match enforcement** ([`entry.rs:108-129`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L108-L129)): prevents dust-level partial matches.

**Strict data length on execution** ([`entry.rs:166`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L166)): when `limit_order` executes, order data must be exactly `UDT_SIZE + ORDER_SIZE` bytes, so trailing data fails validation.

### Assessment

Executed tests confirm several live confusion manifestations under the current deployment assumptions, and separate tests bound the rebinding path.

| ID | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| LO-01 | Known | CKB [does not execute output locks at creation time](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/types.rs#L716-L739), and [`limit_order`'s mint branch](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L71-L79) accepts swapped mint pairings, so mint-time output creation can seed phantom or cross-wired order/master lineages that later pass match or melt validation. |

**Confirmed live manifestations:**

- Phantom orders can be created without master validation: the [phantom mint creation test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/phantom_lineage.rs).
- That phantom lineage can then enter and keep advancing through fake match state without a real master: the [phantom mint continuation test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/phantom_lineage.rs) and the [fake match lineage continuation test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/fake_match_lineage.rs).
- A fake match-shaped order can melt against a real master and strand the real order: the [real-order stranding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/fake_match_lineage.rs).
- Cross-wired or cloned orders can rebind masters at mint or during match: the [mint crosswire test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_mint_creation.rs) and the [cloned-order master-swap test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_live_match.rs).
- The cloned-order continuation is reproduced with `secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all`-protected masters, so the live path is not a weak-lock-only artifact: the [cloned-order master-swap test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_live_match.rs).

**Bounding evidence:** separate tests show that the rebinding path is narrower than arbitrary master rewriting:

- Differing mint capacities and differing match progress both block cross-wiring: the [distinct mint-capacity crosswire block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_blockers.rs) and the [distinct match-progress crosswire block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_blockers.rs).
- Even real orders fail to cross-wire arbitrarily, whether the checked info matches or differs: the [same-info real-order crosswire block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_blockers.rs) and the [different-info mainnet crosswire block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/crosswire_blockers.rs).

The UDT -> CKB zero-UDT fulfilled-order shape still fails at the outer `InvalidMatch` check rather than surfacing a dedicated fulfilled-order guard.

## iCKB Logic

The deployed [`iCKB Logic`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/tree/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src) binary is provenance-blind at cell classification, but once a cell is inside the scripted flow it still preserves receipt and `xUDT` accounting. The subsections below explain both properties and why the currently executed provenance-blind paths still stop short of a confirmed theft or profit finding.

### Core Invariant

[`entry.rs:32`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L32):

```rust
if in_udt_ickb + in_receipts_ickb != out_udt_ickb + in_deposits_ickb {
    return Err(Error::AmountMismatch);
}
```

This equation is the core accounting invariant across all flows:

- **Deposit phase 1**: `0 + 0 == 0 + 0` (deposits and receipts handled by accounting check only)
- **Deposit phase 2**: `0 + receipt_value == out_udt + 0`
- **Withdrawal**: `in_udt + 0 == out_udt + deposit_value`
- **Mixed**: any combination

### Cell Classification

[`celltype.rs:60-82`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L60-L82) classifies every cell in the transaction by examining lock and type script hashes, plus the DAO data shape when the DAO hash is present:

| Lock | Type | Classification | Line |
|---|---|---|---|
| iCKB Logic | DAO deposit (8 zero bytes) | `Deposit` | [L69](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L69) |
| iCKB Logic | anything else | `ScriptMisuse` (error) | [L72](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L72) |
| other | iCKB Logic | `Receipt` | [L75](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L75) |
| other | iCKB xUDT | `Udt` | [L78](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L78) |
| DAO deposit (8 zero bytes) as lock | any | `ScriptMisuse` (error) | [L62](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L62) |
| iCKB xUDT as lock | any | `ScriptMisuse` (error) | [L63](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L63) |
| other | other | `Unknown` (ignored) | [L81](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L81) |

`ScriptType::None` is only synthesized for [missing type scripts](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L48-L50); [`script_type()`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L95-L112) never returns `None` for locks, so the [`(ScriptType::None, _)`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L64) arm is unreachable. NervosDAO withdrawal requests, which have non-zero data, correctly classify as `Unknown` via [`is_deposit_data`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/dao.rs#L17-L22).

### Deposit-Receipt Accounting (`check_output`)

[`entry.rs:86-140`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L86-L140) uses a `BTreeMap<u64, Accounting>` to ensure every group of same-sized output deposits is matched by equal receipt counts.

- Output deposit: [`extract_unused_capacity`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L47-L49) -> keyed by amount, `deposited += 1`
- Output receipt: [`extract_receipt_data`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/utils.rs#L18-L40) -> keyed by `deposit_amount`, `receipted += quantity`
- Final check at [`entry.rs:132-137`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L132-L137): all entries must have `deposited == receipted`

It also validates:

- Deposits: `1000 CKB <= unoccupied_capacity <= 1M CKB` ([`entry.rs:101-106`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L101-L106), bounds at [`constants.rs:5-6`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/constants.rs#L5-L6))
- Receipts: `deposit_quantity > 0` ([`entry.rs:114-116`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L114-L116))
- UDT: `amount <= u64::MAX` ([`entry.rs:123-125`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L123-L125))

### iCKB Conversion (`deposit_to_ickb`)

[`entry.rs:71-84`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L71-L84) uses the same conversion for minting and withdrawal:

```rust
let ickb_amount = amount * ar_0 / ar_m;
if ickb_amount > ICKB_SOFT_CAP_PER_DEPOSIT {
    return Ok(ickb_amount - (ickb_amount - ICKB_SOFT_CAP_PER_DEPOSIT) / 10);
}
```

- Division by zero: impossible (the [RFC 0023 accumulated-rate rule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation) sets `AR_0 = 10 ^ 16` and `AR_i = AR_{i-1} + floor(AR_{i-1} * s_i / C_{i-1})`, so `AR_m` is non-zero).
- Overflow: `u64 * u128` fits in u128 (~1.8e19 * 1e16 = ~1.8e35 < 3.4e38).
- Precision: integer division loses at most 1 shannon per operation.
- Fee/discount symmetry: the same function is used for both input receipts (fee, [`entry.rs:58-59`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L58-L59)) and input deposits (discount, [`entry.rs:52`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L52)). The protocol breaks even: minted amount = burned amount.

### `has_empty_args` Validation

Cell identification relies on the exact deployed script hash. [`utils/utils.rs:14-36`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L14-L36) enforces empty args on:

- The current script instance (covers input lock, input type, output type via CKB's execution model)
- All output locks matching the same code_hash + hash_type ([`utils.rs:29-31`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L29-L31))

Output types don't need explicit checking because they trigger execution and self-validate.

### Assessment

`iCKB Logic` has one state-admission blind spot plus several boundary points:

- **Provenance blind spot:** Receiptless DAO-shaped outputs can be admitted at output-lock creation time because CKB does not execute output locks, and later treated as pool deposits because [`cell_type_iter`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L68-L75) classifies any `ickb_logic`-locked, DAO-typed, deposit-data input as `Deposit` with no receipt-provenance check. The [receiptless deposit-admission test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) confirms that admission-plus-later-classification path.
- **Accepted spread path is still self-funded:** When a separately provided split receipt is paired against a self-funded receiptless aggregate deposit, the contract accepts minting only the soft-cap valuation delta rather than the aggregate principal. The [delta-only spread test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) and the [oversized spread test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) show the accepted spread, while the [deposit-alone spread block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) blocks the deposit-alone variant.
- **Ordinary mixed flows still apply the soft cap per receipt:** The [mixed phase1-phase2 soft-cap test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/soft_cap.rs) shows that adding fresh phase-1 deposits in the same transaction does not turn this into a general aggregate soft-cap bypass.
- **Executed path limit:** The [narrowing comment in the phase-2 claim test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) and the [self-funded principal claim test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) make the current limit explicit: the self-funded aggregate principal remains claimable in DAO phase 2, so the executed path does not show third-party principal theft or duplicated recovery.
- **Prefix behavior:** Trailing bytes in receipt and `xUDT` data reflect prefix-based parsing, while truncated encodings are still rejected. The [receipt trailing-bytes tests](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receipt_encoding.rs), [truncated receipt tests](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receipt_encoding.rs), and [trailing/short `xUDT` output-data tests](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/phase2_xudt_output_data.rs) cover that behavior.
- **Weak-lock boundary:** Recipient-redirection scenarios remain boundary cases and do not apply under the current [whole-transaction-binding user-lock assumption](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#ancillary-scripts).
- **Rounding:** Whole-CKB rounding claims remain false leads. The [rounding mint test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/economic_precision.rs) and the [rounding withdrawal test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/economic_precision.rs) fail unless exact shannon precision is used.

On current executable evidence, that provenance-blind path is real, but it still falls short of a confirmed theft or standalone profit finding.

## Owned Owner

The deployed [`Owned Owner`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/owned_owner/src/entry.rs) binary preserves its pairing invariant under the current assumptions. The remaining questions concern which cells can be paired and who controls the pair at creation time.

### Design

`Owned Owner` pairs owned cells, namely NervosDAO withdrawal requests, with owner cells through a `MetaPoint` derived from the owner cell's `owned_distance` field:

- **Mint:** the owner cell stores a signed distance to the owned cell, so `owned_index == owner_index + owned_distance`.
- **Melt:** both cells must be consumed together.

### Validation

For inputs and outputs separately, the script enforces the same pairing rules:

- Each metapoint must have exactly `owned == 1` and `owner == 1` ([`entry.rs:57-60`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/owned_owner/src/entry.rs#L57-L60)).
- Owned cells must be NervosDAO withdrawal requests: DAO type + non-zero data ([`entry.rs:45-47`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/owned_owner/src/entry.rs#L45-L47)).
- A cell using the script as both lock and type is rejected ([`entry.rs:53`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/owned_owner/src/entry.rs#L53)).

### Assessment

`Owned Owner` leaves four boundary points. The live claim-rotation path stays blocked in the currently modeled flows:

- **Live claim rotation remains blocked:** Attempts to roll a live claim into fresh `Owned Owner` pairs or to crosswire a fully DAO-constrained batch are rejected before a new live pairing survives. The [fresh-pair rotation block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/live_claim_rotation.rs), [new-pair rotation block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/live_claim_rotation.rs), and the [DAO index-rule crosswire block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/dao_crosswiring.rs) show that block.
- **Crosswired later-claim ownership still depends on weak phase-1 authorization:** When phase-1 owner outputs use weak or otherwise non-output-binding locks, later DAO claims can be reassigned across mixed foreign-plus-iCKB batches or fully iCKB batches. The [mixed foreign-plus-iCKB weak-lock crosswire test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/mixed_asset_crosswiring.rs), [two-way weak-lock crosswire claim test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/dao_crosswiring.rs), and [three-way weak-lock crosswire claim test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/dao_crosswiring.rs) show that boundary case. Under the current strong-lock deployment assumption, this is not a present finding.
- **Foreign DAO withdrawal wrapping is allowed:** The [foreign DAO wrapping test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/foreign_dao_wrapping.rs) shows that any DAO withdrawal request can be wrapped and later claimed, because the script checks only DAO type plus withdrawal-shaped data on the owned cell.
- **Creator-side dead states are narrower than arbitrary malformed pairs:** When `Owned Owner` actually executes as a type script, it rejects orphan and count-mismatch shapes, as shown by the [orphan-owner rejection test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/pair_formation.rs) and the [two-owner mismatch test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/pair_formation.rs). But creation still accepts pairs whose owner lock never validated, as shown by the [unspendable foreign-owner-lock test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/foreign_owner_lock_boundaries.rs) and the [limit-order owner-lock stranding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/foreign_owner_lock_boundaries.rs). It also allows lock-only `Owned Owner` look-alikes that later fail on spend, as shown by the [lock-only non-DAO look-alike test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/script_misuse.rs) and the [lock-only DAO-deposit look-alike test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/script_misuse.rs).

---

## Deployment Context and Documented Risks

### Witness Malleability (Documented)

Witness malleability is a documented property, not a new finding. All three scripts use the script-as-lock (unsigned) plus script-as-type (controller) pattern, and none of them reads witnesses.

The [whitepaper states the consequence directly](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#unsigned-lock-witnesses-malleability): "if a script in a transaction needs to store data in the witness and this data can be tampered without the transaction becoming invalid, then this transaction must not employ the scripts presented in the current whitepaper."

### Non-Upgradable Deployment

Deployment is intentionally non-upgradable. The whitepaper's [non-upgradable deployment section](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#non-upgradable-deployment) says the scripts are deployed with a `secp256k1_blake160` zero lock, so no upgrade controller remains.

Any post-deployment bug requires migration to entirely new script deployments and a new dep group.

---

## Conclusion

Under the current deployment assumptions, only the known `Limit Order` confusion attack remains live.

The `iCKB Logic` provenance-blind path exists, but the executed tests still stop at a self-funded edge case.

The remaining `Owned Owner` and cross-script cases are blocked or confined to integration/deployment boundaries.

## Appendix: Scenario Analysis

The appendix records the case-by-case traces that support the component assessments and the findings summary.

### Class 1: Token Inflation (minting iCKB without backing)

These scenarios test whether iCKB can be created without the corresponding deposit-side accounting.

**1A. Direct xUDT minting bypass**

**Attack:** trigger xUDT owner mode without `iCKB Logic` validation.

**Trace:** under iCKB's deployed [`[ickb_logic_hash, XUDT_ARGS_FLAGS]`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L116-L126) with [`XUDT_ARGS_FLAGS = 0x80000000`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/constants.rs#L1-L2), `xUDT` owner mode has two live iCKB routes: a matching input type for receipts and a matching input lock for deposits ([RFC 0052](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0052-extensible-udt/0052-extensible-udt.md#owner-mode-update), [`xudt_rce.c`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L383-L458)).

The only other upstream owner-mode route is the witness [`owner_script` fallback](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L645-L649), but that path looks up the exported [`validate` symbol](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L36-L36) via [`ckb_dlsym`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/26b0b4f15bb6eeb268b70d7ae006e244b7c06649/c/xudt_rce.c#L91-L113). [`iCKB Logic`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/main.rs#L23-L35) is built as a CKB entrypoint instead of an xUDT extension. In the two live cases, `iCKB Logic` co-executes, so the balance equation still applies. The [output-witness owner-script fallback test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/xudt_owner_witness_fallback.rs) and the [input-witness owner-script fallback test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/xudt_owner_witness_fallback.rs) reproduce that attempted route and still fail under `xUDT` amount checks.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**1B. Forge a high-value receipt**

**Attack:** create a receipt claiming more deposits than actually exist.

**Trace:** [`check_output`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L86-L140) accounting requires `deposited == receipted` per amount in a `BTreeMap`. The [over-counted receipt test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receipt_matching.rs) shows that a receipt cannot claim more same-sized deposits than the transaction actually creates.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**1C. Inflate receipt value via AR manipulation**

**Attack:** make a receipt appear to be from an older block (lower AR = higher `iCKB` value).

**Trace:** [`extract_accumulated_rate`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L54-L61) calls `load_header`, which reads the block hash from [`CellMeta.transaction_info.block_hash`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs#L57-L61) and only succeeds when that block is also present in [`header_deps`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/syscalls/load_header.rs#L62-L66). The transaction creator cannot override that linkage.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**1D. Create receipt without prior deposits**

**Attack:** consume a "receipt" that was never backed by actual deposits.

**Trace:** the receipt uses `iCKB Logic` as its type script. Creating it as an output triggers `iCKB Logic`, which validates deposit-receipt accounting. CKB's [UTXO model](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#value-storage) then makes the created cell immutable. No valid receipt can exist without corresponding deposits.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

### Class 2: Token Theft (unauthorized withdrawal)

These scenarios test whether pool deposits can be released without paying the corresponding iCKB cost.

**2A. Withdraw deposits without burning iCKB**

**Attack:** consume a deposit cell without providing sufficient `iCKB`.

**Trace:** the balance equation ([`entry.rs:32`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L32)) requires `in_udt + in_receipts == out_udt + in_deposits`. With no UDT or receipts on input: `0 + 0 != 0 + deposit_value` -> `AmountMismatch`.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**2B. Bypass iCKB Logic during deposit consumption**

**Attack:** consume a deposit cell through `NervosDAO` directly, without `iCKB Logic` running.

**Trace:** deposits use `iCKB Logic` as their lock. CKB always executes input lock scripts (the [lock-script rule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#lock-script)), so there is no way to consume the input without triggering that lock.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**2C. Exploit cell_dep for value extraction**

**Attack:** reference a deposit as a `cell_dep` to extract data without consuming it.

**Trace:** cells used in [`cell_deps`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#code-locating) remain live and are [not considered dead like inputs](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#code-locating). CKB executes [lock scripts for inputs](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#lock-script) and [type scripts for inputs and outputs](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#type-script), so referencing a deposit as a cell dep neither consumes it nor triggers its scripts.

**Result:** **No attack vector.**

### Class 3: Economic Exploitation

These paths matter only if they create a repeatable profit or a material pool imbalance.

**3A. Oversized deposit fee/discount arbitrage**

**Attack:** deposit oversized, get `iCKB` with a 10% fee, then immediately withdraw the same deposit with a 10% discount.

**Trace:** both fee and discount use the same [`deposit_to_ickb`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L71-L84) function with the same parameters. For a deposit at block `M`:

- Phase 2 mints: `deposit_to_ickb(amount, AR_m)` = X iCKB
- Withdrawal costs: `deposit_to_ickb(amount, AR_m)` = X iCKB

Net profit = 0.

**Result:** **No arbitrage.** Fee and discount are symmetric by construction.

**3B. Cherry-pick cheapest deposits**

**Attack:** scan the pool for deposits that require the least nominal `iCKB` to withdraw and then withdraw those deposits first.

**Trace:** [`deposit_to_ickb`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L76) computes `amount * AR_0 / AR_m`. RFC 0023's [maximum-withdrawable-capacity formula](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation) scales the later DAO claim by `AR_n / AR_m`, and the whitepaper's [exchange-rate calculation](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#ickbckb-exchange-rate-calculation) values the same deposit from block `m` at `100000 CKB * 10 ^ 16 / AR_m` `iCKB`, excluding occupied capacity.

Deposits with higher `AR_m` require less nominal `iCKB` because the formula values them lower in `iCKB`, not because the pool applies a discount.

**Result:** **No mispricing.** Each deposit is priced by the same formula, up to integer-division rounding.

**3C. Integer rounding exploitation**

**Attack:** create many small deposits to accumulate rounding errors.

**Trace:** the [rounding mint test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/economic_precision.rs) and the [rounding withdrawal test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/economic_precision.rs) show that the reported whole-CKB or rounded claims fail with `AmountMismatch` unless the exact shannon-precision value is used. The supposed extraction path does not validate on chain.

**Result:** **Blocked by exact shannon-precision accounting.**

### Class 4: Data Manipulation

These cases test whether malformed cells can enter the accounting flow with misleading metadata.

**4A. Receipt with zero deposit_quantity**

**Trace:** [`entry.rs:114-116`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L114-L116) rejects zero-quantity receipts. The [zero-quantity receipt test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receipt_matching.rs) shows the output creation failure directly, so input receipts with zero quantity cannot exist as live cells.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**4B. Receipt amount without matching deposit**

**Trace:** [`check_output`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L132-L137) uses a `BTreeMap` keyed by `deposit_amount`. The [over-counted receipt test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receipt_matching.rs) shows that a receipt cannot claim more same-sized deposits than the transaction actually creates, and the [unmatched receipt-amount test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receipt_matching.rs) shows that a receipt amount with no matching deposit bucket yields `ReceiptMismatch`.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**4C. Cell with iCKB Logic lock + non-DAO type**

**Trace:** once `iCKB Logic` executes, [`celltype.rs:72`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L72) rejects `(ScriptType::IckbLogic, _)` with `ScriptMisuse`. The [lock-only non-DAO output test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/creation_blind_spots.rs) shows that such an output can still be created because output locks do not execute at creation time, but spending it later fails with `ScriptMisuse`.

**Result:** **Cannot be spent successfully.**

**4D. NervosDAO withdrawal request classified as deposit**

**Trace:** [`is_deposit_data`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/dao.rs#L17-L22) checks for exactly 8 zero bytes. Withdrawal requests have non-zero data that stores the block number, so they fall through to `ScriptType::Unknown` and then `CellType::Unknown`.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**4E. Deposit capacity manipulation**

**Attack:** inflate [`extract_unused_capacity`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L47-L49) by manipulating cell fields.

**Trace:** CKB requires [occupied capacity to fit within cell capacity](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#cell-data), and [`extract_unused_capacity`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L47-L49) subtracts that VM-computed occupied capacity from the actual cell capacity. For the standard iCKB deposit shape, the whitepaper's [exchange-rate calculation](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#ickbckb-exchange-rate-calculation) uses `c_o = 82 CKB`. That occupied capacity is fixed by the deposit structure, not chosen independently by the attacker.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**4F. Deposit interest/maturity reset** ([whitepaper#18](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/issues/18))

**Attack:** consume an `iCKB` deposit and create a new deposit at the same output index, effectively resetting the deposit's age and accrued interest in the pool. This would lower pool-wide returns at minimal cost.

**Trace:** the specific same-index reset described here is blocked by `NervosDAO` phase 1. The receiptless aggregate-deposit variant is a different claim.

1. **NervosDAO blocks it**: when a DAO deposit is consumed, [`validate_withdrawing_cell`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L337-L389) requires the output at the same index to be a withdrawal request with non-zero data containing the deposit block number. A new deposit with 8 zero bytes fails the [`stored_block_number != deposit_header.block_number`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L382-L385) check because genesis block number `0` does not match the real deposit block. The transaction is rejected.

2. **By contrast, the broader provenance-blind path is a different claim.** The [receiptless deposit-admission test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) shows that `ickb_logic` later accepts a receiptless DAO-shaped output as a structurally valid deposit input once it exists.

The [delta-only spread test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) and the [oversized spread test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) show that the contract accepts a self-funded soft-cap spread, while the [deposit-alone spread block test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) blocks the deposit-only variant.

The [narrowing comment in the phase-2 claim test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) and the [self-funded principal claim test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/receiptless_deposit_blind_spot.rs) make the limit explicit: the executed path still does not prove receipt-backed-principal theft or duplicated recovery.

So the specific "same output index" reset is blocked by NervosDAO. The receiptless aggregate-deposit variant stays a self-funded provenance-blind edge case rather than a confirmed double-claim exploit.

**Result:** **Blocked for the same-index reset described here.** The receiptless aggregate-deposit path exists, but the current tests still stop short of proving receipt-backed-principal theft or duplicated recovery.

### Class 5: Cross-Script Interactions

These scenarios check whether behavior that is safe in isolation breaks once multiple scripts share a transaction.

**5A. Witness malleability during withdrawal** ([whitepaper#22](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/issues/22), credit: @XuJiandong)

**Attack:** tamper with witness data for the `iCKB Logic` lock group (unsigned lock). All three witness fields in the group (`lock`, `input_type`, `output_type`) are malleable because `iCKB Logic` does not use signature-based verification.

**Trace:** `iCKB Logic` does not read witnesses. `NervosDAO` does read `input_type` from the witness to locate the deposit header ([`dao.c:63-98`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L63-L98)). If an attacker tampers with that header index, `NervosDAO` later compares the claimed deposit block number with the actual deposit header and fails at [`deposited_block_number != deposit_data.block_number`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/814eb82c44f560dbdad2be97eb85464062920237/c/dao.c#L190-L191).

The [iCKB malformed witness test](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/dao_phase2_batching.rs) and the [Owned Owner malformed witness test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/melt_pairing_and_witness.rs) reproduce that malformed header-index witness failure path in `iCKB Logic` and `Owned Owner` withdrawal flows.

The [whitepaper's unsigned-lock-witnesses section](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#unsigned-lock-witnesses-malleability) already documents that general malleability risk and warns against combining these scripts with witness-dependent logic.

**Result:** **Can cause transaction failure (griefing), cannot cause fund loss.** This is a liveness issue, not a safety issue. [Documented in the whitepaper](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#unsigned-lock-witnesses-malleability).

**5B. Separate lock/type group execution desync**

**Attack:** exploit dual execution in the hope that one run passes while the other fails.

**Trace:** CKB requires ALL script groups to pass ([the verifier loop](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/verify.rs#L197-L213) returns an error if any `verify_script_group(...)` call fails). Both lock and type executions see identical cells at absolute indices and perform the same balance checks. If either fails, the transaction is rejected.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**5C. Non-empty-args iCKB Logic variant**

**Attack:** create a cell with `{iCKB Logic code_hash, Data1, [0x01]}` as type, hoping to bypass validation.

**Trace:** different args produce a different script hash, so the cell is not recognized by [`script_type()`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/celltype.rs#L95-L112). Even if it executes as its own type group, it still fails [`has_empty_args()`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L14-L36). The non-empty-args poisoning regressions in [phase2_sibling_classification.rs](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/phase2_sibling_classification.rs) cover both output-sibling and input-sibling variants.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**5D. Orphaned Owned Owner cell**

**Trace:** [`owned_owner/entry.rs:57-60`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/owned_owner/src/entry.rs#L57-L60) requires every metapoint to have exactly `owned==1, owner==1`. The [orphan-owner rejection test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/pair_formation.rs) shows that an orphan type-script owner cell is rejected immediately. A separate lock-only orphan case can still be created at output-lock creation time and later strand, as shown by the [orphan withdrawal-request dead-state test](scripts/tests/src/tests/owned_owner/pair_formation.rs).

**Result:** **Blocked when `Owned Owner` executes.** Lock-only look-alikes can still be created and later fail.

**5E. Limit Order value decrease**

**Trace:** [`limit_order/entry.rs:103-105`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L103-L105) enforces value conservation with `C256` (checked `U256`). Any decrease is rejected.

**Result:** **Blocked.**

**5F. Limit Order confusion attack**

**Trace:** CKB builds lock groups only from input locks, while type groups come from both input and output types ([`types.rs:716-739`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/6730f8023810d0888aa80c6a0d54cc2af918097d/script/src/types.rs#L716-L739)). A limit-order cell is the lock-only `(true, false)` case in [`limit_order/entry.rs:48-56`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/limit_order/src/entry.rs#L48-L56), so an attacker can create phantom order outputs with arbitrary master outpoints without running `limit_order` at creation time. One manifestation is a fake order that shares a real master outpoint; if a user later melts the wrong order, the real order becomes permanently stranded.

**Result:** **Known vulnerability.** [Documented in whitepaper](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/blob/cdbabf653ba98eacea397f94f8c894f32a538d6c/README.md#confusion-attack-on-limit-order). The [real-order stranding test](scripts/tests/src/tests/limit_order/fake_match_lineage.rs) confirms the later real-order stranding path on the deployed binary.

The whitepaper's mitigation is front-end lineage checking from the original mint transaction. Under the deployed lock-only design, the chain does not validate phantom orders at creation time because the order cell is created as an output lock-only cell.

### Class 6: Edge Cases

The remaining scenarios are boundary checks, platform constraints, or known economic limitations.

**6A. Boundary values**

**Trace:** the minimum deposit check uses `<` ([`entry.rs:101`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L101)), so exactly 1000 CKB is allowed. The maximum uses `>` ([`entry.rs:104`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L104)), so exactly 1M CKB is also allowed. The boundary-value regressions in [deposit_bounds.rs](scripts/tests/src/tests/ickb_logic/deposit_bounds.rs) cover both edges.

**Result:** **Correct.**

**6B. u128 overflow in balance equation**

**Trace:** [`overflow-checks = true`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/Cargo.toml#L6) is enabled in `scripts/Cargo.toml`. Overflow panics and rejects the transaction.

**Result:** **Blocked** (by the compiler setting and practical bounds).

**6C. Division by zero in deposit_to_ickb**

**Trace:** the [RFC 0023 accumulated-rate rule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation) sets `AR_0 = 10 ^ 16` and `AR_i = AR_{i-1} + floor(AR_{i-1} * s_i / C_{i-1})`, so every deposit header has non-zero `AR_m`. [`deposit_to_ickb`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L71-L84) cannot divide by zero.

**Result:** **Impossible.**

**6D. `extract_unused_capacity` underflow**

**Trace:** CKB VM enforces `capacity >= occupied_capacity` for all cells. The subtraction at [`utils.rs:48`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L48) is safe.

**Result:** **Impossible.**

**6E. Chain reorganization between deposit phases** ([whitepaper#15](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/issues/15))

**Attack:** deposit phase 1 is included in block B. Before phase 2, a chain reorg removes B. The phase 2 transaction still references B's header in `header_deps`, but B no longer exists in the canonical chain.

**Trace:** CKB consensus requires all blocks listed in `header_deps` to exist in the canonical chain ([RFC 0022](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/4b502ffcb02fc7019e0dd4b5f866b5f09819cfbe/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#header-deps): "the transaction can only be added to the chain if all the block listed in `header_deps` are already in the chain (uncles excluded)"). If B is reorged out, then (a) the phase 1 deposit cell no longer exists as a live cell, so it cannot be referenced, and (b) the `header_dep` pointing to B is invalid. The phase 2 transaction is rejected.

**Result:** **Blocked by CKB consensus rules.** Reorgs cannot create phantom deposits.

**6F. Busywork / pool dilution attack** ([whitepaper#8](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/issues/8))

**Attack:** an attacker with large capital repeatedly deposits CKB in standard deposits and then withdraws, cycling through the pool. This shifts the maturity distribution: the remaining deposits are younger, so users must wait longer for a mature deposit.

**Trace:** the attack requires sustained capital commitment. Per the [whitepaper analysis](https://github.com/ickb/whitepaper/issues/8), controlling the first available epoch requires about `0.6%` of pool capital, while controlling the first 3 days requires about `10%`. With a `0.3%` APR per 180 epochs, a user blocked for 1 epoch loses about `0.0017%` interest.

The attacker earns nothing because the cycled CKB returns to them, still pays transaction fees, and must lock capital for 180 epochs per cycle. As the pool grows, the capital requirement rises proportionally while the impact per unit of capital falls.

**Result:** **Requires sustained capital and yields less impact as the pool grows.** This is a known limitation, not a vulnerability.

**6G. Same-block receipt and deposit consumption**

**Attack:** create a deposit plus receipt in `TX1`, then consume both in `TX2` (receipt for phase 2 plus deposit for withdrawal) in the hope that the AR difference yields free `iCKB`.

**Trace:** both were created in the same block (`TX1`). [`extract_accumulated_rate`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/utils/src/utils.rs#L54-L61) returns the same AR for both. Since `receipt_value == deposit_value`, the balance equation yields `0 + receipt_value == out_udt + deposit_value` -> `out_udt = 0`. No net `iCKB` is minted.

**Result:** **No profit.**

**6H. Race between receipt creation and deposit withdrawal**

**Scenario:** a user creates deposit D plus receipt R in phase 1. Before the user performs phase 2, someone else withdraws D.

**Trace:** R still exists and is valid, and its `iCKB` value is fixed by the creation-block AR. D being consumed by someone else is expected pool behavior, so the user still converts R to `iCKB` normally in phase 2.

The protocol remains balanced because the withdrawer paid [`deposit_to_ickb(D)`](https://github.com/ickb/contracts/blob/454cfa966052a621c4e8b67001718c29ee8191a2/scripts/contracts/ickb_logic/src/entry.rs#L71-L84) `iCKB`, and the receipt holder receives the equivalent `receipt_iCKB_value(R)`.

**Result:** **Pool accounting stays balanced.**
